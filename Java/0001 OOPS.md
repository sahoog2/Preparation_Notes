### **📌 2️⃣ Classes & Objects**

✅ How do you **declare and instantiate objects** in Java?  
✅ What is the difference between **static** and **non-static members** in a class?

----------

### **📌 4️⃣ Polymorphism**

✅ What is **polymorphism**, and what are its types?  
✅ What is the difference between **compile-time and runtime polymorphism**?

✅ Can an abstract class implement an interface?

🔹 **Example Question:**  
👉 **How does abstraction improve software design?**

----------

### **📌 7️⃣ Interfaces & Abstract Classes**

✅ What is an **interface** in Java?  
✅ What is the difference between **abstract class and interface**?  
✅ Why can an interface have **default and static methods** from Java 8?  
✅ Can we declare **variables in an interface**?  
✅ Can an interface **extend another interface**?  
✅ What happens when two interfaces define the same method?

🔹 **Example Question:**  
👉 **How does Java 8 differ in interface behavior compared to earlier versions?**

----------

### **📌 8️⃣ Constructors & Destructors**

✅ What is a **constructor**, and how does it work?  
✅ What happens if a constructor is declared **private**?  
✅ Can constructors be **overloaded**?  
✅ Can constructors be **inherited**?  
✅ Difference between **constructor and method** in Java?  
✅ How does Java handle object destruction (since there's no destructor)?

🔹 **Example Question:**  
👉 **What is the purpose of the `super()` call inside a constructor?**

----------

### **📌 9️⃣ Method Overloading & Overriding**

✅ Can overloaded methods have different **return types**?  
✅ Why can't method overloading be done by just changing the return type?  
✅ Can we override `main()` method in Java?  
✅ Can private and final methods be overridden?  
✅ Can overloaded methods have different **access modifiers**?

🔹 **Example Question:**  
👉 **What is the difference between overloading and overriding with real-world examples?**
