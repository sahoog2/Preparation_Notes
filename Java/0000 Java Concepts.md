### **🚀 Categories of Java Interview Questions**
Java interviews typically assess **core concepts, coding ability, problem-solving skills, and best practices**. Below are the major categories:

---

### **📌 1️⃣ Core Java Concepts**

 - ✅ [Object-Oriented Programming
       (**OOPs**)](https://github.com/sahoog2/Preparation_Notes/blob/main/Java/0001%20OOPS.md)
  - ✅ Data Types & Variables   
  - ✅ Operators & Expressions   
  - ✅ Control Statements (Loops, Conditionals) 
  - ✅ Exception Handling

 

🔹 **Example Question:**  
👉 **What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize` in Java?**

---

### **📌 2️⃣ Collections & Data Structures**
✅ Array, List, Set, Map  
✅ HashMap vs TreeMap  
✅ Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
✅ Thread-Safe Collections (ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList)  

🔹 **Example Question:**  
👉 **How does a HashMap internally work in Java?**

---

### **📌 3️⃣ Multithreading & Concurrency**
- ✅ Thread Lifecycle  
- ✅ Synchronization & Locks  
- ✅ Executor Framework  
- ✅ `volatile`, `synchronized`, `Atomic variables`  
- ✅ Deadlock detection & prevention

🔹 **Example Question:**  
👉 **What is the difference between `synchronized` keyword and `Lock` interface in Java?**
👉 Implement Producer-Consumer Problem using BlockingQueue
👉 Use synchronized, Lock, and volatile for thread safety
👉 Thread-safe Singleton Implementation
🔹 Example Question:
👉 What is the difference between Callable and Runnable in Java multithreading?
🔹 Tip: Callable can return a value, whereas Runnable does not

---

### **📌 5️⃣ Java 8 and Beyond (Functional Programming)**
- ✅ Lambda Expressions  
- ✅ Streams API  
- ✅ `Optional` Class  
- ✅ Functional Interfaces (`Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`)  

🔹 **Example Question:**  
👉 **How does Java Streams API improve performance compared to traditional loops?**

---

### **📌 6️⃣ JDBC & Database Connectivity**
- ✅ Connecting to MySQL/PostgreSQL  
- ✅ Transactions & Commit/Rollback
