### **Quick Revision: Symbols in Class Diagrams**

Class diagrams use specific symbols to represent different aspects of object-oriented systems, such as classes, relationships, attributes, and operations. Hereâ€™s a concise list of key symbols for quick revision:

---

### **1. Class Representation**
- **Class Box**:
  - A rectangle divided into three sections:
    - **Top Section**: Class name.
    - **Middle Section**: Attributes (fields or properties).
    - **Bottom Section**: Methods (functions or operations).

---

### **2. Visibility Modifiers**
Used to define the access levels for attributes and methods:
- **+**: Public
- **-**: Private
- **#**: Protected
- **~**: Package (default visibility)

---

### **3. Relationships**
These represent the connections between different classes:
- **Association**:
  - A solid line with optional multiplicity indicators (e.g., `1`, `1..*`).
- **Aggregation**:
  - A hollow diamond on one end of the line.
  - Represents a "whole-part" relationship (weak ownership).
- **Composition**:
  - A filled diamond on one end of the line.
  - Represents a "whole-part" relationship (strong ownership).
- **Inheritance (Generalization)**:
  - A solid line with a hollow arrow pointing to the superclass.
- **Implementation**:
  - A dashed line with a hollow arrow pointing to the interface.
- **Dependency**:
  - A dashed line with an arrow pointing to the dependent class.
- **Multiplicity**:
  - Indicates the number of instances (e.g., `0..1`, `1..*`).

---

### **4. Attributes and Methods**
- **Attributes**:
  - Listed in the middle section of the class box.
  - Syntax: `visibility name : type`.
  - Example: `+ age : int`.
- **Methods**:
  - Listed in the bottom section of the class box.
  - Syntax: `visibility name(parameterList) : returnType`.
  - Example: `+ getAge() : int`.

---

### **5. Other Symbols**
- **Static Members**:
  - Underlined attributes or methods.
- **Abstract Classes/Methods**:
  - Italicized class names or method names.
- **Enumerations**:
  - Represented like classes but with a stereotype `<<enumeration>>`.
- **Interfaces**:
  - Represented like classes but with a stereotype `<<interface>>`.

---

### **6. Notes and Constraints**
- **Notes**:
  - Represented by a folded rectangle attached to a class or relationship with a dashed line.
- **Constraints**:
  - Text annotations enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
  - Example: `{ordered}`.

---

### **7. Packages**
- **Package**:
  - Represented by a folder icon or rectangle with a tab on top.
  - Used to organize classes into groups.
