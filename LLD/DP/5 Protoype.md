### **Prototype Registry Design Pattern**

The **Prototype Registry** is an extension of the **Prototype Design Pattern**. It centralizes the management of prototypes by storing a collection of pre-configured objects (prototypes) in a registry. This allows clients to fetch and clone prototypes efficiently, without directly managing object initialization or configurations.

This approach is particularly useful when there is a need for a **repository** of objects that can serve as blueprints for creating multiple similar objects. Letâ€™s dive into its details and understand how it works.

### **What Is Prototype Registry?**

- **Prototype Registry** is a design pattern that complements the **Prototype Design Pattern**.
- It involves maintaining a registry (a repository or storage) of prototypes, each identified by a unique key.
- Clients can retrieve a prototype by its key, clone it, and use the cloned object.

---

### **When to Use the Prototype Registry Pattern**

1. **Object Reuse**: When you have a set of objects that are frequently used but slightly customized, and you want to avoid creating them from scratch each time.
2. **Centralized Management**: When you need a centralized way to manage a collection of prototypes.
3. **Scalability**: When the number or types of prototypes might grow, and a flexible registry-based solution is required.

---

### **Components of the Prototype Registry**

1. **Prototype Interface**:
   - Declares the `clone()` method for creating object copies.

2. **Concrete Prototypes**:
   - Implement the `Prototype` interface and define how cloning works for the object.

3. **Prototype Registry**:
   - Maintains a collection of prototypes.
   - Provides methods to add, remove, and retrieve prototypes by key.

4. **Client**:
   - Interacts with the registry to fetch and clone prototypes.

---

### **Advantages**

1. **Centralized Control**: Prototypes are managed in one location, simplifying maintenance.
2. **Efficiency**: Object cloning reduces the overhead of re-initialization.
3. **Flexibility**: Prototypes can be added or removed from the registry dynamically.
4. **Scalability**: Easily extendable to handle more prototypes.

---

### **Disadvantages**

1. **Complexity**: Adds an additional layer (the registry) to the design.
2. **Cloning Challenges**: Deep and shallow copies must be carefully managed to avoid shared mutable state.

### **Implementation Example in Java**

Letâ€™s explore the Prototype Registry in action with an example of creating shapes.

#### **1. Define the Prototype Interface**
```java
public interface Shape extends Cloneable {
    Shape clone();
    void draw();
}
```

#### **2. Implement Concrete Prototypes**
```java
// Concrete Prototype: Circle
public class Circle implements Shape {
    private int radius;

    public Circle(int radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public Shape clone() {
        return new Circle(this.radius);
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle with radius: " + radius);
    }
}

// Concrete Prototype: Rectangle
public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private int width;
    private int height;

    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public Shape clone() {
        return new Rectangle(this.width, this.height);
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Rectangle with width: " + width + " and height: " + height);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Implement the Prototype Registry**
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class ShapeRegistry {
    private Map<String, Shape> prototypes = new HashMap<>();

    // Add prototype to the registry
    public void addPrototype(String key, Shape prototype) {
        prototypes.put(key, prototype);
    }

    // Retrieve and clone prototype
    public Shape getPrototype(String key) {
        Shape prototype = prototypes.get(key);
        return (prototype != null) ? prototype.clone() : null;
    }
}
```

#### **4. Client Code**
```java
public class PrototypeRegistryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a registry
        ShapeRegistry registry = new ShapeRegistry();

        // Add prototypes to the registry
        registry.addPrototype("Circle", new Circle(10));
        registry.addPrototype("Rectangle", new Rectangle(20, 30));

        // Retrieve and clone prototypes
        Shape clonedCircle = registry.getPrototype("Circle");
        Shape clonedRectangle = registry.getPrototype("Rectangle");

        // Use the cloned objects
        clonedCircle.draw();
        clonedRectangle.draw();
    }
}
```

### **Key Features in This Example**

1. **Registry as Central Storage**:
   - The `ShapeRegistry` acts as a centralized repository for prototypes.
2. **Cloning Through Registry**:
   - Clients retrieve a prototype from the registry and clone it instead of instantiating new objects directly.
3. **Dynamic Management**:
   - New prototypes can be added to the registry dynamically.

### **Comparison with Prototype Pattern**

| Feature                       | Prototype Pattern                     | Prototype Registry Pattern             |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                   | Focuses on cloning a single prototype | Centralized management of multiple prototypes |
| **Object Access**             | No centralized access to prototypes  | Provides a centralized registry for fetching prototypes |
| **Scalability**               | Limited to predefined prototypes     | Easily extendable with dynamic prototype addition |

### **Real-World Applications**

1. **Document Templates**:
   - Frequently used templates (e.g., invoice, report) can be stored in a registry and cloned as needed.
2. **Game Development**:
   - Pre-configured game objects (e.g., characters, weapons, terrain) can be stored and reused efficiently.
3. **GUI Libraries**:
   - Store frequently used UI components (e.g., buttons, panels) in a registry for quick cloning.

### **Conclusion**

The Prototype Registry Pattern is a powerful addition to the Prototype Pattern, offering centralized management and flexible reuse of objects. It simplifies the process of cloning and extends the capabilities of the Prototype Pattern to handle multiple prototypes dynamically.
